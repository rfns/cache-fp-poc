## Cach√© Functional Programming (proof-of-concept)

This prototype describes the usage of methods for manipulating collections using an approach similar to what functional programing languages do. However, it's pretty limited to that. There's no extensive support to employ any other functional programing feature, since the ideal would be COS supportting it.

Still, it can be pretty useful if you need some extra control over your collections without breaking a sweat.

To see how to use it check the class [FP.Sample](https://github.com/rfns/cache-fp-poc/blob/master/cls/FP/Sample.cls).
